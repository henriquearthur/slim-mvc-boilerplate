# Slim Framework MVC Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate using [Slim Framework](http://slimframework.com), MVC pattern and third-party libraries.

**Documentation is still in progress. Hold on.**

## The goal

As described on Slim documentation, you don't always need a kitchen-sink solution like [Symfony](https://symfony.com) or [Laravel](https://laravel.com). Slim provides a minimal set of tools to build your application, which is great for APIs, but you miss some tools if you are using Slim to build something else, like a website with many features.

However, Slim also provides easy methods to use third-party libraries on your code. Almost everything you need is out there - Cache, CSRF protection, Database management, Logging, Mail solution, Templates and more.

But searching for those implementations can be a waste of your time. You can just use this boilerplate which covers it all for you using MVC pattern.

## Features

This boilerplate provides:

- All the features on [Slim Framework](http://slimframework.com) which includes dependency injection container, [PSR-7](https://github.com/php-fig/http-message) implementation and more.
